# COVID-19 Project
This project is focused on getting open source COVID-19 Data, processing, analyzing and visualizing that data.

The scripts will initially focus on using R but will eventually translate the scripts into Python and Julia.

## Getting the Data
The first stage is finding open source data then determining whether there is an available API or a file download.  Once we have the data we can process each source appropriately before analyzing and visualizing the data.

This first script will get data from the **[COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/api)**.

Subsequent data sources will be referenced here as well.
